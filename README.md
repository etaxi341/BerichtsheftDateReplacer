# BerichtsheftDateReplacer

## What is this?

This is just a little 15 Minute funproject.
In Germany every trainee has to write a "Berichtsheft" every one or two weeks.
I hated putting the date and the number into the fields so i made this little tool.

## How to use?

1. Download [here](https://github.com/etaxi341/BerichtsheftDateReplacer/releases)
2. Prepare a "Berichtsheft" Template
3. Replace the beginning date with ##FROMDATE##
4. Replace the ending date with ##TODATE##
5. Replace the writing date with ##WRITEDATE##
6. Replace the number of "Berichtsheft" with ##NUM##
7. Run the .exe you just downloaded
8. Select the template file
9. Select your startdate of the training
10. Select your enddate of the training
11. Select how often you need a "Berichtsheft" (Weekly, every other week, ...)
12. Press Generate
13. Now there are numerated "Berichtshefte" in the folder where your template is located.

## Why is the code so ugly?

Like I said... It was a 15 Minute project. It took me longer to write this README.md than the whole code of this project.
